## Attach Data to Elements

### A single file app!

The entire app we're building is inside of only one file: `app/username.hbs`.

If you want to start with a blank slate (with no Remake attributes on the page), like we do in the video, replace your `username.hbs` template with this one: [starter-username.hbs](https://gist.github.com/panphora/a1f39772ebc837b29173c5fb18887a8d).

Also, make sure you signed up and are logged in to an account!

### A quick note on saving

If you're following along with the video and you want your data to auto-save on page load (not a great idea in production, but fine in development), then comment out the last line in the `remake-init.js` file in `app/assets/js/remake-init.js`
