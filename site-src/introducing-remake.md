Welcome to Remake!

Remake helps you create web apps really fast.

And its getting better every day.

### What makes Remake Different

It takes a much different approach than most modern frameworks.

1. It doesn't separate data from the view, making it much easier for you to see and work with the state of your entire app from a single perspective
2. It treats the elements on the page just like objects in your database, automatically syncing them to the back-end
3. It has advanced routing and data saving capabilities built in, allowing you to build new pages without really thinking too hard

Also, because it's built on top a traditional, server-rendered architecture, the front-end Remake library that handles editing and saving data isn't required if the page isn't editable â€” leaving your pages lightweight for most users!

### What you need to know

If you want to learn Remake, you only need to know:

* HTML
* Handlebars (a simple HTML templating library)
* 6-8 custom Remake data attributes

Even if you're a beginner to web app development, you can learn Remake in a week or two and start building powerful apps!

### How to get started

Follow along as we create a **Trello Clone** in the tutorial!

Along the way, we'll explain what Remake is all about, how it gets its powers, and why it's the fastest way to build a web application.
