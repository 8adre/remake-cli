Welcome to the first step in the Remake tutorial!

We'll learn how to build a fully-featured Kanban application in about 30 minutes.

**Follow along in the videos to get started!**

### What makes Remake Different

It takes a much different approach than most modern frameworks.

1. It doesn't separate data from the view, making it much easier for you to see and work with the state of your entire app from a single perspective
2. It treats the elements on the page just like objects in your database, automatically syncing them to the back-end
3. It has advanced routing and data saving capabilities built in, allowing you to build new pages without really thinking too hard

Also, because it's built on top a traditional, server-rendered architecture, the front-end Remake library that handles editing and saving data isn't required if the page isn't editable â€” leaving your pages lightweight for most users!
