## Build web apps. Fast.

<b>Super-powered HTML for quickly building fast-loading, dynamic, server-rendered web apps that feel modern and are easy to use.</b>

* Feels like prototyping
* Easy-to-learn syntax
* Develop exclusively on the front-end 
* Server-rendered & SEO friendly
* Perfect for small teams and solo developers

### How it works

**Creating a web application is hard.** You need to install packages, configure your build process, create API endpoints, set up a database, and load in some demo data, *and that's all before even getting started!*

**It can be easier!**

Remake makes it possible to build a web app entirely in your front-end code.

It does this by converting your page into a database, so when you move elements around on the page, their data is also moved!

This makes it possible to handle all of these complicated actions automatically, without any extra hookup or configuration:

* Editing data
* Moving data
* Removing data
* Adding and rendering data
* Viewing a single piece of data

And there's much more to come!

### Roadmap

In the near future, Remake will have support for:

* Automatic form handling
* Image uploads
* Image cropping and manipulation
* Sharing data between users
* Real-time updates

### Build Something Great

Join in to learn how to:

* Spend more time talking with customers
* Commit to constantly improving your ideas
* Build something people love
