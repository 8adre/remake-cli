## Build web apps. Fast.

<b>Super-powered HTML for quickly building fast-loading, dynamic, server-rendered web apps that feel modern and are easy to use.</b>

* Feels like prototyping
* Easy-to-learn syntax
* Develop exclusively on the front-end 
* Server-rendered & SEO friendly
* Perfect for small teams and solo developers

### How it works

**Creating web applications is hard.** You need to install packages, configure your build process, create API endpoints, set up a database, and load in some demo data, *and that's all before even getting started!*

**It can be easier!**

Remake makes it possible to build a web app entirely in your front-end code.

It does this by basically converting your page into a database, so when you move elements around on the page, their data is also moved!

Remake also comes with a built in inline edit popover for editing data at the click of a button.

This makes it possible to handle a lot of complicated CRUD operations automatically by adding a single data-* attribute:

* Attaching data to elements
* Editing & removing data from the page
* Moving data around the page
* Rendering new data into the page

And there's much more!

### Roadmap

In the near future, Remake will also have support for:

* Automatic form handling
* Image uploads
* Image cropping and manipulation
* Sharing data between users
* Real-time updates
