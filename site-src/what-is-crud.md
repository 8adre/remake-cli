# What is a CRUD web application?

A CRUD Web application is the most basic type of web application. It allows you to create and edit data and show that data to your users.

The simplest example of a CRUD web application would probably be a blog. A blog allows you to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. 

A more advanced web application like an analytics platform (e.g. Google Analytics) or a social network (e.g. LinkedIn) is not considered a CRUD web application because it has many advanced features that go beyond simply creating and updating data.

### CRUD Means
* Create
* Read
* Update
* Delete

### CRUD Web Applications Allows Users To
* **C**reate data
* **R**ead data in a list or as individual items
* **U**pdate data in a list or as an individual item
* **D**elete data from a list or from an individual item

### Example CRUD Web Applications
* **Wordpress** lets you create, update, and delete blog posts and pages
* **Wikipedia** lets you create, update, and delete articles
* **Craigslist** lets you create, update, and delete postings

### Beyond CRUD
* **Facebook** has a lot of CRUD functionality, but it also has real-time messaging, recommends posts and events to you, and has a powerful search. These features go way beyond a basic CRUD web app.
* **Twitter** and **Instagram** are pretty basic CRUD web apps on the surface, but since they also have the ability to follow and they recommend content, they're not considered CRUD web apps.
* **Amazon** also has a lot of CRUD features (creating, viewing, updating, deleting products), however their recommendations and search functionality are so advanced they go beyond the basic definition of a CRUD web app.
