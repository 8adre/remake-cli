# CRUD Means

* Create
* Read
* Update
* Delete

### CRUD Web Apps

A CRUD web app is any web app that lets you **create** things, **read**/view them, **update** them, and **delete** them.

CRUD web apps are usually simpler than other types of web apps.

### Example

A good example is **a blog**.

With a blog, you can:

* Create posts
* Read posts
* Update posts
* Delete posts

#### Other examples

* **Wordpress** lets you create, update, and delete blog posts and pages
* **Wikipedia** lets you create, update, and delete articles
* **Craigslist** lets you create, update, and delete postings

### Beyond CRUD

Social networks (e.g Twitter / Instagram / TikTok) let you like posts and follow people. 

Analytics platforms (e.g. Google Analytics / Hubspot) let you connect users and actions and see advanced graphs. 

These both go beyond basic CRUD.
