### What is a CRUD Web App?

A CRUD web app will let you:

* **Create** things 
  * For example: posts, articles, tasks, and/or images
* **Read**/view things
* **Update** things
* **Delete** things

CRUD web apps are usually simpler than other types of web apps. 

They usually have a list of items &mdash; and you can click each item to view it on a separate page. Or you can use a button in the interface to edit or delete it.

### Example of a CRUD Web App

A good example: **A Blog**. You can:

* Create blog posts
* Read blog posts
* Update blog posts
* Delete blog posts

#### Some more CRUD examples:

* **Wordpress** lets you create, update, and delete blog posts and pages
* **Wikipedia** lets you create, update, and delete articles
* **Craigslist** lets you create, update, and delete postings

### Beyond CRUD

**Social networks** (e.g Twitter / Instagram / TikTok) let you like posts and follow people. 

**Analytics platforms** (e.g. Google Analytics / Hubspot) let you connect users and actions and see advanced graphs. 

These go beyond basic CRUD.
