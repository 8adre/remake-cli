## What is a CRUD web app?

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. Any web app that allows you to perform these basic operations is considered a CRUD web app.

For example, [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/), the popular blogging software, lets you:

<div style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 2px;"><b><span style="display: inline-block; line-height: 1em; padding: 2px 4px 4px; background-color: #1971c2; color: #e7f5ff; border-radius: 2px;">C</span> &nbsp;Create</b> blog posts</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 2px;"><b><span style="display: inline-block; line-height: 1em; padding: 2px 4px 4px; background-color: #1971c2; color: #e7f5ff; border-radius: 2px;">R</span> &nbsp;Read</b> blog posts</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 2px;"><b><span style="display: inline-block; line-height: 1em; padding: 2px 4px 4px; background-color: #1971c2; color: #e7f5ff; border-radius: 2px;">U</span> &nbsp;Update</b> blog posts</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 2px;"><b><span style="display: inline-block; line-height: 1em; padding: 2px 4px 4px; background-color: #1971c2; color: #e7f5ff; border-radius: 2px;">D</span> &nbsp;Delete</b> blog posts</div>

<div class="spacer--16"></div>

This makes Wordpress a CRUD web app.

### Why is CRUD good?

CRUD web apps are great for managing, sorting, filtering, and editing data. They can be really nicely designed and easy to use.

Some of the most popular and useful web apps on the internet are really just simple CRUD web apps under the hood. They’re usually simple and let you just focus on a single goal.

Some great examples of useful CRUD web apps: a recipe collecting website, a searchable book database, an expense tracker app, a notes app, a personal diary, a blog engine, a resume builder, an editable knowledge base, a portfolio website builder, or a roadmap planning tool.

### A framework made for CRUD

There are many frameworks that make creating CRUD web apps easier. [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) are great for this.

However, there’s an awesome framework specifically designed for building CRUD web apps that lets you build them faster than ever before.

It’s called [Remake](https://remaketheweb.com/). It lets you use only HTML to build a full web app in a matter of horus. And it comes with user accounts, CRUD components, and simple, easy deployments built-in!
