**UPDATE ðŸŽ‰:** Remake v2.0 is fully operational and all the documentation is up-to-date!

Remake is a simple, open source framework. It lets you transform an HTML & CSS design into an interactive, editable web app with custom HTML attributes.

- Simple syntax
- User accounts & persistent data
- Inline editing & file uploads
- No backend coding

## Why Remake?

> What if every HTML webpage knew how to save, edit, and add items to itself?

![Diagram of how Remake works](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/364330/98125645-b5d2b980-1e82-11eb-909f-527bf0ff224e.png)

Remake was made for indie makers who want to build editable web apps quickly. Have you ever created a design and wished people could just start using it? Remake lets you do that.

- **Not a templating library.** Remake lets you build *full-stack* web apps with *just* front-end code. Remake takes care of the rest: user accounts, persistent data, and instant deployments.
- **Not a front-end framework.** Remake renders templates server-side (with Handlebars.js). This means your pages will load quickly, even on low-powered devices and over slow connections.
- **Not a CMS.** Remake lets you build a CMS on top of HTML & CSS templates using a few custom HTML attributes. You can make a page editable in just a few minutes &mdash; and users can login and have their own data.
- **Not a prototyping tool.** Remake lets you build real apps for real users. It has security and scalability built in. It's easy to build with, so it feels like prototyping, but it's meant for building full apps.
- **Not a no-code tool.** Remake is an open source framework that you download and add your own HTML & CSS code to. You own the code. There's no platform lock-in and you have 100% control over your app's design.

**2. Create a project using the Remake CLI**

```
npx remake create my-app
```

**3. Run the project**

```

Remake aims to equalize power on the internet. A few companies own the platforms where the rest of us publish posts and websites â€” but owning a platform is usually beyond our reach. Remake switches this narrative and empowers you to build your own publishing platform.
