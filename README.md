Remake is a simple, open source framework. It lets you transform a static website into an interactive, editable web app with a few custom HTML attributes.

- Simple syntax
- User accounts & persistent data
- Inline editing & file uploads
- No backend coding

**IMPORTANT:** A NEW VERSION of this framework was just released. **Don't use the current docs**. For now, you can use this [thorough recipes page](https://recipes.remaketheweb.com/) to learn the new syntax.

## Why Remake?

> What if every HTML webpage knew how to save, edit, and add new items to itself?

![Diagram of how Remake works](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/364330/98125645-b5d2b980-1e82-11eb-909f-527bf0ff224e.png)

Remake is ideal for indie hackers who want to build editable web apps quickly. Have you ever created a static website and wished people could just start using it? Remake lets you do that.

- **Remake lets you build full-stack apps with front-end code.** Remake comes with user accounts, a persistent database, and everything you need to deploy a working application.
- **Remake lets you build CMS-like features on top of a static template.** Users can login to your site and edit their own copy of it.
- **Remake is so easy to use it feels like prototyping.** But it's designed for building scalable, production web apps.
- **Remake gives you control over your design.** You can use any CSS framework and style your pages however you want.
- **Remake is server rendered.** This makes it ideal for SEO and loading pages quickly. The front-end framework isn't even loaded if a user can't edit the current page.

## Get started

**1. Install [Node.js (12.16+)](https://nodejs.org/)**

**2. Create a project using the Remake CLI**

```
npx remake create my-app
```

**3. Run the project**

```
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

You now have an app running at `http://localhost:3000`. Your app's code is in the `/app` directory and your database is in the `/_remake-data` directory.

## Remake’s Mission

Remake aims to equalize power on the internet. A few companies own the platforms where the rest of us publish posts and websites — but owning a platform is usually beyond our reach. Remake switches this narrative and empowers you to build your own publishing platform.
