**UPDATE ðŸŽ‰:** Remake v2.0 is fully operational, there are [new step-by-step recipes](https://recipes.remaketheweb.com/), and [all the documentation](https://docs.remaketheweb.com/) is up-to-date!

Remake is a simple, open source framework. It lets you transform an HTML & CSS design into an interactive, editable web app (with just a few custom HTML attributes).

- Simple syntax
- User accounts & persistent data
- Inline editing & file uploads
- No backend coding

## Why Remake?

> What if every HTML webpage knew how to save, edit, and add items to itself?

![Diagram of how Remake works](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/364330/98125645-b5d2b980-1e82-11eb-909f-527bf0ff224e.png)

Have you ever designed something and wished people could just start using it? Remake lets you do that.

- **Build full-stack web apps with front-end code.** Remake takes care of the rest: user accounts, persistent data, instant deployments, and routing. Each user gets their own account and data.
- **Produces real apps, not prototypes.** Remake feels like prototyping because it was designed to. The goal was to make web development feel like using a single template and a single JSON file.
- **You control your app and its design.** Remake is open source. You own the code. There's no platform lock-in and you have 100% control over your app's design.
- **Secure, scalable, and fast.** Highly secure authentication. And server-rendered, so your pages load quickly even on low-power devices and slow connections.

## Get started

**1. Install [Node.js (12.16+)](https://nodejs.org/)**

**2. Create a project using the Remake CLI**

```
npx remake create my-app
```

**3. Run the project**

```
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

You now have an app running at `http://localhost:3000`. Your app's code is in the `/app` directory and your database is in the `/app/data` directory.

## Remakeâ€™s Mission

Remake aims to equalize power on the internet. A few companies own the platforms where the rest of us publish posts and websites â€” but owning a platform is usually beyond our reach. Remake switches this narrative and empowers you to build your own publishing platform.
